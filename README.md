# Starbucks Location Suggestion App

<p> This is a Location Suggestion App which allows the decision maker to zone-in on areas which are ideal for the next Starbucks location given a set of criteria: target clientele(thier socio-economic class and age), crime situation, transpotation sites, etc. After setting up the criteria, areas satisfying the conditions will be highlighted on the map. In addition, a table with relevant information and statistics will be displayed, whihch can help the viewer gain a full understanding of the pros and cons of each area. </p>

<p><b>Note</b>:
  <ul><li>To speed up loading the app, here I only used New York data.</li>
  <li>There are many factors influencing the decision on location selection. The location selection criteria in this app are limited. However, new factors can be added and updated if more related data are available.</li></ul>
